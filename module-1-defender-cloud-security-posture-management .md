# Exercise 1: Defender Cloud Security Posture Management

### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Overview
 
A hypothetical organization, "Acme Inc." had a robust cybersecurity infrastructure in place. However, one day, an attacker used a brute force or password spraying attack to gain access to an Internet-exposed server of the organization. 

The attacker could quickly move laterally through the network, exploiting vulnerabilities on the Internet-exposed servers and gaining access to the organization's Storage Accounts, SQL servers, and Key Vaults. The SOC department was alerted by Defender for Cloud on the “Brute Force, Password Spray” IOC/IOA, and quickly realized something was wrong when they noticed unusual activity on the servers and Storage Accounts. 

In response to the attack, the security engineers leveraged the attack path analysis to identify the entry point of the attack and the path the attackers used to move laterally through the network. Based on this analysis, they were able to close the entry point and cut off the attackers' access to the organization's data. 

However, the IT department didn't stop there. They also took a proactive approach by implementing security recommendations to fix the vulnerabilities on the Internet-exposed servers and prevent similar attacks in the future. They also implemented a robust incident response plan and conducted regular security training for employees to educate them on how to identify and avoid brute force and password spraying attacks. 

Thanks to the combination of both reactive and proactive measures, Acme Inc was able to prevent a major data breach and keep their sensitive information safe. This hypothetical use case demonstrates the importance of having both a reactive and proactive approach when it comes to cybersecurity, including performing attack path and security risk analysis, implementing security recommendations, assigning/managing change actions to the proper owners, and educating employees to prevent future attacks.  

Next exercise will show how to leverage the Attack Path feature of Defender for CSPM.
